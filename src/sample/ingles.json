We mainly focus on making customized handbikes taking care of each detail. Our goal is to make the handbike fit the client instead of making the client fit the handbike. We use the best brands and components in the market looking for the less weight possible. That has taken us to build handbikes for some of the worldâ€™s best athletes.",
